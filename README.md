# Middle-of-the-Linked-List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Example 2:

![lc-midlist2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88260025/223756701-e6e7a708-9852-469b-a54c-5be29c07bf83.jpg)

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100
